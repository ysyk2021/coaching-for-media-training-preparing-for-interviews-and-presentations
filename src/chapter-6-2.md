* **Demonstrate Empathy**: Show genuine empathy towards their concerns, demonstrating that you understand and acknowledge their perspective.

Clarification and Restatement

Provide Relevant Information

For example, phrases like "That's an important point, and what I would like to emphasize is..." or "While I understand your concern, it's important to remember that our main focus is..."
* **Consistency with Key Messages**: Ensure that your responses are aligned with your key messages and overall communication goals. Use these opportunities to reinforce your key points.

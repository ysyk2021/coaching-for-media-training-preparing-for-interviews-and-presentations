In this chapter, we will explore effective techniques for staying on message during media interviews and presentations. As a spokesperson or presenter, it is crucial to deliver your key messages clearly and consistently to ensure that your intended message is effectively communicated. By employing these techniques, you can maintain control of the conversation, navigate distractions, and ensure that your core messages resonate with your audience. Let's delve into the valuable techniques for staying on message.

Prepare Clear and Concise Key Messages
--------------------------------------

* **Identify Key Messages**: Clearly identify the key messages you want to convey during the interview or presentation. Ensure that they align with your overall goals and objectives.
* **Keep Messages Concise**: Craft your key messages in concise and memorable language. Aim for simplicity, clarity, and brevity to make them easily understood and retained by your audience.

Prioritize and Rank Your Messages
---------------------------------

* **Establish Priority**: Rank your key messages in order of importance. Determine which messages are fundamental and should be emphasized, even if time becomes limited during the interview or presentation.
* **Allocate Time Accordingly**: Allocate appropriate time to each key message based on its priority. This ensures that you have enough time to convey your most crucial points effectively.

Use Message Pillars
-------------------

* **Create Message Pillars**: Develop supporting pillars for each key message. These pillars are additional talking points or examples that reinforce and support the main message. They provide depth and context to your key messages.
* **Refer to Pillars Frequently**: During the interview or presentation, refer to your message pillars to expand on your key messages. This helps you provide detailed information while staying aligned with your main points.

Implement Bridging Techniques
-----------------------------

* **Utilize Bridging Phrases**: Use bridging phrases to smoothly transition from one question or topic to another while redirecting the conversation back to your key messages. Examples include phrases like "That's an important point, but let me emphasize that..." or "While we're on that topic, it's crucial to remember that...".

Practice Active Listening
-------------------------

* **Listen Attentively**: Pay close attention to the interviewer's or audience's questions, comments, and concerns. This allows you to address their specific points while staying connected to your key messages.
* **Bridge Back to Key Messages**: As you listen, look for opportunities to bridge back to your key messages. Connect the question or comment to one of your main talking points to ensure consistent messaging.

Use Transitional Phrases
------------------------

* **Employ Transitional Phrases**: Use transitional phrases to smoothly transition from one key message to another during the interview or presentation. Examples include phrases like "Furthermore...", "In addition...", or "Moreover...". These phrases help signal a shift in focus while maintaining the connection to your overall message.

Repeat and Reinforce
--------------------

* **Repeat Key Messages**: Repeat your key messages at strategic moments during the interview or presentation. Repetition reinforces important points and helps ensure that your messages resonate with the audience.
* **Reinforce with Examples and Stories**: Bolster your key messages with relevant examples, stories, or case studies that illustrate their application or impact. This adds depth and credibility to your messages.

Stay Focused and Disciplined
----------------------------

* **Maintain Focus**: Stay focused on your key messages and avoid getting sidetracked by tangential or unrelated topics. Remind yourself of your objectives and stay disciplined in steering the conversation back to your main points.
* **Avoid Distractions**: Be aware of potential distractions during the interview or presentation, such as provocative questions or interruptions. Stay composed and redirect the conversation back to your key messages if necessary.

Bridge to Your Agenda
---------------------

* **Align Responses with Agenda**: Ensure that each response aligns with your intended agenda and the key messages you want to convey. Avoid going off on tangents that might derail your overall messaging strategy.
* **Steer the Conversation**: Use bridging and redirecting techniques to steer the conversation towards topics or questions that allow you to reinforce and expand on your key messages.

Seek Opportunities for Segues
-----------------------------

* **Look for Natural Segues**: Keep an eye out for natural segues in the conversation that allow you to smoothly transition to one of your key messages. Look for cues or openings that can be leveraged to direct the discussion in your desired direction.

Rehearse and Role-play
----------------------

* **Rehearse Your Messages**: Practice delivering your key messages in a confident and natural manner. Rehearse various scenarios, incorporating bridging techniques, to ensure smooth transitions between different answers.
* **Role-play Interviews**: Conduct simulated interviews with a media training coach or a colleague playing the role of the interviewer. Practice staying on message while addressing a variety of questions and scenarios.

In conclusion, staying on message is essential for effective communication during media interviews and presentations. By preparing clear and concise key messages, utilizing bridging techniques, and employing active listening, you can maintain control of the conversation and ensure consistency. Repeat and reinforce your key messages, stay focused and disciplined, and seek opportunities for segues. With practice, preparation, and the implementation of these techniques, you can confidently stay on message, deliver your core points effectively, and achieve your communication goals in media interactions or presentations.

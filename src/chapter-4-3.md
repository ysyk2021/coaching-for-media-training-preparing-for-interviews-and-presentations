Identify Your Key Messages
--------------------------

The first step in staying on message during interviews is to identify your key messages. These are the main points or themes you want to communicate to your audience. Identify the three to five most important messages you want to convey and practice communicating them clearly and concisely.

Anticipate and Prepare for Questions

Anticipating and preparing for questions is another important technique for staying on message during interviews. Research the topic or issue being discussed, and anticipate the types of questions you might be asked. Develop clear and concise answers that align with your key messages.

Use Bridge Phrases
------------------

Using bridge phrases is another effective technique for staying on message during interviews. This involves linking the question being asked to one of your key messages. For example, "That's a great question, and it reminds me of something important I want to share..." or "I appreciate your interest in that topic, but what's really important to remember is..."

Practice Active Listening
-------------------------

Practicing active listening is also essential for staying on message during interviews. Listen carefully to the interviewer's questions, and respond thoughtfully and respectfully. Avoid getting defensive or off-topic, as this can detract from your key messages.

Conclusion

Staying on message during interviews requires preparation, poise, and confidence. Identify your key messages, anticipate and prepare for questions, use bridge phrases, and practice active listening. By mastering these techniques, you can become more effective at staying on message during interviews, and enhance your credibility and professionalism in media training and presentations.

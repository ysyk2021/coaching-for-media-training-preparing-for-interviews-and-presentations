Before conducting an interview, it's important to research the interviewer and media outlet. Understanding who will be conducting the interview, what topics they typically cover, and their audience can help you tailor your message and approach to the interview.

Some tips for researching the interviewer and media outlet include:

* Reviewing their website and recent articles or broadcasts

Staying on message is critical during media interviews, as it helps you deliver a consistent and effective message. Here are some techniques for staying on message:

* Bridge: Use bridging phrases to help transition back to your key message points. Examples include "what's really important is..." or "let me give you the bigger picture."
* Flag: Use flags to emphasize your key message points. Examples include "remember..." or "it's important to stress that..."
